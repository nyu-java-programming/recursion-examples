# Recursion Examples

Some examples of recursion in the Java programming language. These were originally in a book on the discount rack outside of [The Strand](https://www.strandbooks.com/) book shop in Manhattan, written in a now-abandoned programming language. The examples were far clearer and more practical than others I've seen in textbooks, so I have translated them into the still-surviving Java language. I did not buy the book. Unfortunately, I did not take down the title or author of the book so cannot give proper attribution - please let me know if you find the original source.
